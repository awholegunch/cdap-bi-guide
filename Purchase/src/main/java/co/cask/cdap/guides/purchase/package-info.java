/**
 *
 * Sample CDAP Application that reads purchase events from a Stream, and makes it available for ad-hoc querying.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     Send events of the form "customerName,quantity,productId" to the purchaseStream.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The PurchaseFlow reads the purchaseStream and converts every input String into a Purchase object and stores
 *     the object in the purchases DataSet.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    You can use SQL to formulate ad-hoc queries over the purchases Dataset. This is done by
 *    a series of ``curl`` calls, as described in the RESTful API section of the Developer Guide,
 *    via the cdap CLI, the CDAP web interface, or a BI tool.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
