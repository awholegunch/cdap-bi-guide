# Purchase example

Sample CDAP Application that reads purchase events from a Stream, and makes it available for ad-hoc querying.

Features introduced: Custom Dataset with ad-hoc querying capability and integration with a Business Intelligence tool.

  - Send events of the form "customerName,quantity,productId" to the purchaseStream.
  - The PurchaseFlow reads the purchaseStream and converts every event into a
    Purchase object and stores the object in the purchases Dataset.
  - You can use SQL to formulate ad-hoc queries over the purchases Dataset. This is done by
    a series of ``curl`` calls, as described in the RESTful API section of the Developer Guide,
    via the cdap CLI, the web interface, or from a BI tool.
